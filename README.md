# Delphi Interpreter - Project 2

## Overview

This project is a continuation and extension of Project 1, where we initially implemented an interpreter for a subset of the Delphi (Object Pascal) language using ANTLR4 and Java.

In **Project 2**, we enhance the language support by introducing critical language features such as loops, scoping, user-defined procedures and functions, loop constructs, and control flow mechanisms like `break` and `continue`. This interpreter builds upon the grammar and visitor-based AST evaluation logic developed in Project 1.

## üîß Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ From Project 1

- Class and Object Declarations  
- Constructors and Destructors  
- Public and Private Fields (Encapsulation)  
- Method Declarations and Calls  
- Object Instantiation and Field Access  
- Input/Output (`ReadLn`, `WriteLn`) support  
- **Bonus (from Project 1):**
  - Inheritance Support  
  - Interface Declaration & Implementation

---

### New in Project 2

#### Looping Constructs
- `while-do` loops  
- `for-do` loops

#### Control Flow
- `break` and `continue` support 

#### Procedures & Functions
- User-defined procedures  
- User-defined functions  
- Recursive procedures/functions  
- Local variables within procedures and functions

#### Scoping Rules
- **Static scoping** implemented:
  - New blocks (e.g., `begin...end`, `while`, `for`, etc.) create new scopes  
  - Procedure/function bodies create new scopes  
  - Variable resolution follows chain of visible scopes

#### BONUS Features
- **Constant Propagation**:
  - Expressions using only constants are precomputed at compile-time  

- **Formal Parameter Passing**:
  - Procedures and functions can declare and receive parameters  
  - Correct scoping of parameters is handled internally

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Java 11 or higher  
- ANTLR 4.9.2  
- Bash terminal (for Unix/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)

### üîß Compilation and Execution and Testing

```bash
# From the root of the project directory (from antlr_plp folder)
java -jar lib/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar -visitor delphi.g4 -o src
javac -cp .:lib/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar src/*.java
java -cp .:lib/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar:src src/DelphiInterpreter.java test/<testfilename>.pas
```
